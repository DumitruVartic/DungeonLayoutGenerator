# Dungeon Layout Generator

This project is an implementation of procedural generation algorithms for creating a game layout.

The algorithm for procedural generation is based on the algorithm described in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/) on the r/gamedev subreddit and the modified algorithm by vazgriz [described here](https://vazgriz.com/119/procedurally-generated-dungeons/).
